**Demo:** https://basemax.github.io/FaceDetectionJS/

> Note: Since for face detections we need to load and download models, so if your internet speed is not good you need to wait some seconds.

Thanks to **Vincent MÃ¼hler** since without [`face-api.js`](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/) this project would not exist.
